# experiment-gpr-single
Part of "Experimenting with GitHub packages".

This is a repository publishing a single package. ("gpr" = "GitHub Packages registry"; comes from their workflow action)

Sources: 
- Quickstart: https://docs.github.com/en/packages/quickstart
  - Biases towards GH Packages personal repo view.
    - @_YOUR_USERNAME_ = @_prenda-school_ (organization username)
  - Personal authentication concerns are bypassed by using workflow action
  - Note: once published, wait a minute for it to appear as a connected package under the repository homepage (and organization profile -> packages tab).
